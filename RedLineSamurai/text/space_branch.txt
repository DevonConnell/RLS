n \nFirst I had to debrief the Colonel, as protocol dictated.
n \nWhile Sheiletta was in direct command of our division Dugal was in charge of this base.
n \nI can't say I know much about the man.
n \nFrom what I have been able to gather he has a very serious character and a scientific mind.
nvl clear
n \n\nIt is a bit odd that one of our military's best biologists would choose to operate a remote station.

n \nOne would imagine the room of a Colonel's too be relatively sizable.
n \nAnd Dugal's would have been, had there not been so many books and scientific equipment around.
n \nMany citizens go their entire lives without reading printed text.
n \nThe Colonel certainly enjoyed the relics of the past.
nvl clear
'Colonel Dugal' "Rousseau...captain are you?{w=1}  You look more like some trash from the Tergis or Janapor Sectors."
n \nI was accustomed to stern-faced drill sergeants in the past.
n \nBut this man...{w=1}was in a league of his own.
n \nThis wasn't the first time a commanding officer looked down upon me because of my heritage.
n \nLong have I gotten over taking offense to such base remarks.
nvl clear
n \n\nStill, it was far from pleasant.
n \nOlder gentlemen like the Colonel here still held the intolerances the Lucredium Wars birthed.
n \nI paused to recover my nerve.
nvl clear
cR "You are correct in that I am originally from Janapor, sir."
'Colonel Dugal' "Enough.  What of your report?"
n \nI started giving out the details of our route and handed him an encrypted data disk from Central Command.
n \nIt was just standard procedure and consisted primarily of an updated map of unit locations and operations.
n \nOnly at HQ was the entire plan held, of course.
n \nYou'd only risk compromising your entire operation if a fringe station such as this were overtaken.
nvl clear
cR "Of course the greatest concern is the very present and unexpected Rebel threat."
cR "My unit just returned from a battle with thirteen advanced Rebellion MCUs."
'Colonel Dugal' "What of it?"
n \n\n\nWhat of it?
nvl clear
cR "W-well sir, I strongly believe this station to be in great danger."
cR "Had we not arrived when we did..."
'Colonel Dugal' "You want some sort of medal?{w=1}  Is that it?"

c2 "You're a grandpap!"
n \n\nGales's mother's sister is married to this man.
n \nFor someone without any family, it all seemed rather complicated.
n \nThe two of them were nothing alike, and didn't even share the same blood.
n \nI guess families can bring even the most different of people together.
