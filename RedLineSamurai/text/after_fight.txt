'Sheran' "Captain Rousseau!  I'm coming in!"
n \n\n\n\n\nWhat was my chief intelligence officer doing in my room at 5 AM?
n \nProbably nothing good.

n \nThe head officer in charge of this base, murdered?
n \nAnd...
n \nI was too busy getting into drunken brawls.
n \nDamn you, Rousseau!

n \n\n\n\n\nI spotted Commander Sheiletta and some of her subordinates outside the General's room.
n \nI must have been looking rough as I was getting stares from everybody.
n \nSheiletta especially seemed shocked as her face went bright red.

n \n\n\n\nSo that's why I felt so cold.
n \nIn my hurry I forgot to change out of my pajamas.
n \nThat is, I was only wearing my boxers.

cR "My apologies.  But we have a greater issue at hand."

n \n\n\nI made my way inside the room.
n \nThe scent of death was slight, but it was there.
n \nIt reminded me of Janapor.
n \nSlumped over in his chair, like he fell asleep reading his book.
n \nExcept for a dried-red smile across his neck.

n \n\n\n\nMy officer was thoughtful enough to bring my clothes.

n \n\n\n\n\nRuthlessly the woman soon had everyone jumping around her.
n \nBefore I knew it the two of us where going through everyone's background files along with the camera footage.

n \n...it would seem she hadn't forgotten last night's incident.
n \nBut why would such a little thing cause her to lose her composure like this?
