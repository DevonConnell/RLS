n \n\n\nNo, I'm better then this.
n \nGales is drunk, and whatever he thought was just a misunderstanding.
n \nWhat would it show to my soldiers if I gave into my emotions here?
n \nI wouldn't be able to look them in the eye.

n \nHe was none to happy about it.
n \nThankfully he passed out shortly thereafter.
n \nI...have to get out of here.

n \nReason enough to go there.

n \nThe Angelus Mobile Combat Units were among the finest the UHA had to offer.
n \nAnd I'm not talking about just the equipment.
n \nWhile our equipment is high-quality, it's still far behind that of the Specialists.
n \nIt's our leadership and communication that sets us apart.
nvl clear
n \nI can take some credit for the tactical prowess of the 15th, but we're just a single squad.
n \nSheiletta is the one giving the Angels the strategic orders.
n \nThe difference in a tactical mind like mine and a strategic mind like hers...
n \nIt was that of a lake and an ocean.
nvl clear
n \nI was worried about her.
n \nIt had been over a year since I saw her last, but I've never imagined her in such a state.
n \nInstinct told me something more was at work here then I was currently aware of.
n \nBut intuition told me there was nothing I could probably do.

n \n\nI could only make out bits and pieces of what she was saying.
n \nShe's talking about that incident at training camp.
n \nThe two of us and Gales held off a terrorist attempt to obtain over a dozen nuclear weapons.
n \nSheiletta...
nvl clear
n \n\nIt did jumpstart her career.
n \nHarsh critics will say it's because of her father's position as General.
n \nThose fools didn't know just what she was capable of.
n \nThe Angelus Sector held the uprising when it came from underneath us.
nvl clear
n \n\nThe top brass had already cut their losses, to them the sector was expendable.
n \nBut Sheiletta didn't even hesitate.
n \nUnder her guidance Angelus is now regarded as one of the safest sectors in UHA space.
n \nI will admit it's hard to tell from her right this moment..
Sc "That...that bitch!{w=1}  I'll, I'll..."
n \n\n\n\nShe started dozing off when we reached her door.
n \nI apologized to the powers above as I frisked her for the keycard.
n \nSweat dropped from my brow as I found myself in a rather compromising position.
