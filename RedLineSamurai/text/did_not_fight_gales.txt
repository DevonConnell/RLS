n \n\n\n\nAll my pilots know whose Mech that is.
n \nMine.{w=1}
n \nThe rest of the order detailed 'prepare firearms' and 'orders given at location'.

cR "Thank you.{w=1}  Troops, please secure your service firearms from your MCUs."
n \n\n\n\nWhile their faces showed uncertainty, they did as I said.
n \nThey were good soldiers.
n \nWhile your average MCU pilot these days rarely touches a gun, all Angelus divisions are trained in basic riflemanship.
n \nThis may be a time when those extra lessons came in handy.

cR "As you all know Rebel presence in this sector is far greater then any of us could have anticipated.
cR We all believed this was going to be a routine patrol run through a few backspace Alliance safe zones."

cR While I hope I am wrong, I must ask each of you to prepare for the very worst."
'Troops' "Sir yes sir!"
n \n\n\n\nI noticed two members absent.
n \nNaomi wouldn't know the secret order.
n \nBut Gales would.
n \nI hope he's just off being stupid somewhere.
n \nThe station's intercom sounded.

'Intercom' "All security personnel report to the main hall at once!  This is not a drill!{w=1}  Repeat, all security personnel report to the main hall immediately!"
n \n\n\n\nMy teeth started to grind without my knowing.
n \nThat was the Commander's voice sure enough.
n \nShe should have informed me of her intentions.
n \nThe doors surrounding the docking bay automatically locked shut.
n \n I cursed vocally.  She was trying to keep us out of it!

n \n\n\n\nTo say I was pissed was quite the understatement.

n \nI barked orders to my troops and made a sprint for the command room as soon as Kaemon tore through the door.
