n That is inaccurate.{w=1}  When paired in partner combat exercises Gales would time and again come up with ridiculous manuevers,{w=1} always with more style then substance.
n \n\nIt was more to impress chicks with than anything else.
n \n\nThis is a horrible idea.

n Take a seat a let me explain how this stunt works.
n \nI zig-zag while firing intermittent bursts with my assault rife, while Gale hides in my shadow.
n \nHe's able to hide because of the g-particles my boosters exhaust, but it's not a sure thing.
n \nWhen it suits him he takes a shot with his X-6 particle cannon in condensed mode,{w=1} which uses the beams of my assualt rifle as cover.
nvl clear
n \nThe particles from the X-6 travel at a rate far faster then my rifle's, making for a surprise attack that will keep the target unbalanced.
n \n\nThe finisher is even more foolhardy.
n \nAt full speed I grab on to the enemy mech, spin it around facing Gales,{w=1} and he pummels it the X-6 cannon.
n \nIn practice it has only added to my maintenance bills.
