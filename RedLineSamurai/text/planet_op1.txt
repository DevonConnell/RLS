n My mind whirled around like a twister, while sharp pains fluttered around my body.
n \nIn my eyes danced bright colors of reds and blues before deciding on an opaque white.
n \nSlowly feeling was returning to my body.
n \nI had to grit my teeth to keep from shouting;{w=1} but my throat was far too parched for that anyway.

'Voice' "Don't bother moving."

'Wounded Man' "...{w=1}who..."

n \nAnd I am afraid that I have lost myself.

n \n I had gotten the feeling that this woman did not care much for me.
n \nHad I hurt her in the past?
