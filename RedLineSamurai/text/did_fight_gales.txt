n \nI had to go after her.
n \nShe hadn't forgotten the memories of our time back at Gamma Base, and neither did I.
n \nMyself and Gales were as green as the grass on Eigmon Prime's second largest space colony.
n \nWe were assigned as members of Sheiletta's squad, before she had yet to achieve the rank of Captain.
n \nIt would not be unfair to say we were dysfunctional.
n \nGales addressing her as 'Her Royal Hardass' never ended well.
nvl clear
n \n\n\nBut looking back those really were my fondest memories.
n \nWe were good friends, even if it looked like we were our greatest enemies.
n \nAnd when we faced numbers 3 to 20 in a Rebel attack on our nuclear facility, we didn't give them an inch.
n \nUnder her leadership the squad that got left behind on a training exercise (Gales had insulted the Sergeant) became heroes.
n \nNow, where the hell is she?
nvl clear
n \n\n\n\n\nI followed an unknown set of corridors and through a door I had not seen before.
n \nThe air seemed heavier and my heart starting racing.
n \nFor a reason I could not explain, I was tense.

n \n\n\n\nI entered a large room with what looked to be a massive power generator located in the middle.
n \nI spotted some movement in the control room.
n \nI ran up several flights of stairs, though I couldn't explain my rush.
n \nUn...{w=1}unmoving bodies littered the floor.
n \nAt the controls was none other than-

n \n\n\n\nSo Naomi was the traitor after all...
n \nI regret not bringing my pistol with me.
n \nIt would seem I'll need to fight her hand-to-hand.
n \nShe must have guessed my thinking as a wicked smile came to her lips.

N "Or rather, did."
n \n\n\n\nThat's all I needed to hear.
n \nI didn't care if she was Head General of the Alliance at this point.
n \nBut in my haste for vengeance I fell right into her trap.
n \nShe brought her right leg around fast-{w=1}inhumanly fast.
nvl clear
n \n\n\n\nI had to be honest with myself here.
n \nWhen it comes to speed and agility, she's way out of my league.
n \nThe only way I could beat her is in a battle of brute strength.
n \nThe way you do that is eliminate distance, making the fight less about striking and more about grappling.
