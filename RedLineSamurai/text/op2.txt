n My fears were confirmed.  It seemed far too strange for bandits to have evaded our sensors until they were right on top of us,{w=1} to have approached our position so quickly.
n \nA space pirate in these parts considered himself lucky to obtain a C-class suit, much less an upgraded B.
n \n\nNo, space pirates would never have engaged a United Human Alliance 14-suit patrol.
